# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. For details on how to fork and turn in the project, see section 3 of the github education  [documentation](https://education.github.com/guide/forks). After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Interacting with Data](https://github.com/Brown-BIOL2430-S04-Fall2015/syllabus) seminar in fall 2015. This project examines marine community structure on experimental plates left out on rocky reefs in the Galapagos Islands over two months. These plates were bolted to the rock under cages intended to exert variable herbivore access. The goal is to provide an intuitive, interactive view of how marine life responds to variable herbivore pressures.

## The data

The data behind this visualization are from unpublished data on benthic communities in the Galapagos Islands. All figures you see displayed are based on empirical results of visual censuses, videos, and photos maintained by the Witman Lab at Brown University

* www.witmanlab.com

The data themselves take the form of either integer counts of mobile invertebrates, or as percentage values for primary space-occupying organisms living on the seafloor. In the original data file, columns are descriptive variables and species, rows are samples.

## Background



Examples of previous visualizations of similar data or processes, if any exist... Include links or add images to markdown document... how were data mapped to aesthetics in these previous approaches? Was there filtering?

Shortcomings of previous approaches, or potentially interesting gaps between previous approaches...

The static images normally presented of community data present a limited view of how patterns change in response to variable top-down pressures. This dynamic interaction with data will facilitate honing in on thresholds, which species respond more or less to herbivory, and how they relate to the variable herbivore guilds driven by wave exposure.

## This project

### Mapping of data to aesthetics

How will aesthetic attributes ( X / Y / color / shape / size /texture / etc ) will be mapped to the data?

X-axes will correspond to species. Y-axes will correspond to percent cover or numerical abundance. Color will correspond to experimental treatment. 

### Filtering

Are data filtered? ie in some views are some data not mapped to particular attributes of the image? What is the goal of the filtering?

Data are not filtered.

### Extra ink

Are there aesthetic attributes that are not mapped to the data? If so, what purpose do they serve ( redundancy for robustness / improve visual metaphor / but data in context / beauty / etc )?

Are any data mapped to more than one aesthetic attribute? Why?

In addition to color, labels are assigned to sites to aid in visualization. The Galapagos map is used to associate the relative location of each montioring site to the regional geography and potential exposure to different oceanographic processes.

### Motion

If motion is used, what purpose does it serve ( metaphor (eg representing motion in real world) / transition continuity between views / etc )

Motion represents continuity between species

### Perspective

To what extent is perspective (eg mappings) controlled by users vs hard coded in advance? How does this project aid in exploration vs exposition?

Mapping is set by user control in terms of which time period and site to look at. 

## Assessment

Was the new visualization successful at providing insight that was not possible or more difficult with previous approaches?

What are the main limitations of new approach?

What are future directions this could go in?
